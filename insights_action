First glance thoughts:
- looks like a regression problem
- all values in the training matrix close to 0 - maybe they're already scaled?
- looks cleaned; although the test data has a point missing - maybe more missing data?

Aims:
- do visualizations
- don't touch the test data; do all work on the training data alone - split into train and val.
- check patterns/ correlations between different columns and targets; and between columns
- PCA? - looks like there are many dimensions
- two models required: random forest regressors? SVM regressors? - google for different types of regressors?
- try a NN approach to this as well due to a lot of dimensionality - only after EDA & other simple models
- do everything with pandas dataframe - easier for merging with ML models
- go through scikit-learn book and see if you have covered all the methods
- use pipeline from sklearn for the initial preprocessing
